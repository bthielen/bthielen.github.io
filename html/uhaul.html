				<h1> task </h1>
				<p class="bold"> Reimagine how a user experiences the U-haul equipment reservation process, beginning from the landing page.</p>
				
		

				<div id="personaText"> 		
				<h1>personas</h1>


					<p>Design for first-time movers, with no self-towing experience, who could be overwhelmed by the site’s options. Think of users with needs beyond just moving between homes.</p>

				<h1>current process</h1>
				<p>The current process includes 4 upsell pages before the checkout, frustrating users with unnecessary steps. This process does not alert users if their selected equipmen is unavailable in their area until after they chose a pick up location. <br> U-Haul’s self-storage product, the U-Box, is confusing to users because its name does not make its function immediately apparent.</p>
			</div>


				
					<h1> my role</h1>
					<p>I worked with a team of 4 other UX designers to brainstorm ideas together and each designer created individual wireframe solutions. I contributed a full wireframe and mock-ups of 2 of our wireframe concepts. The U-Haul.com live site will reflect the ideas approved by U-Haul corporate leadership.</p>

				<h2>equipment filter form </h2>
				<p>I used colors consistent with the branding guide, utilizing soft beige as the backdrop of the form containers, consistent with the style guide. I integrated the filter drop-down options into a sentence to make them easy to understand. I made U-Haul's 4 most popular services easily accessed by just changing tabs on one page, accenting the inactive tabs in the site's signature orange color. </p>
				<img class="images" src="images/mockupforms.png" alt="mockup1" style="width: 100%">
				<h2>equipment bundle design + upsell</h2><p>I designed the bundle displays using visual sectioning, clearly highlighting each item's price and including the call-to-action "add bundle to cart" right next to the entire bundle's total, leading the consumer's eye the whole way. I designed the add-ons to be added to the bundle with a single click, elimating extra steps that could make customers reconsider the additional purchases. </p>
				<img src="images/mockupbundles.png" alt="mockup2" style="width: 100%">
				<h2>pick up location </h2>
				<p>I placed the item rental information at the top of the screen, leaving no doubt in the customer's mind what they were picking up. I highlighted the costumer's biggest concern, the distance of each pickup location, in blue and placed large orange markers on the map corresponding to each location. </p>
				<img src="images/mockuplocations.png" alt="mockup"  style="width: 100%">
				<h2>review order</h2>
				<p>I divided the review order page into easily-scannable sections, organizing by location and purchases. I included information specific to each subsection as shaded bars attached the section with brightly colored icons to remind the customer of the time and date details.</p>
